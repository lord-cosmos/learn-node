- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

THe order of execution : 
foo
done
Read Error


line 14, call is a async operation, so it will be started
outside of main thread - on a worker thread, once read is complete the callback from line 4 
will be enqueued to pending callback queue.

the foo() -> consoles "foo"
line 16 consoles "done"


the async operation that has been triggered on line 14,
when all the callbacks are done, if any, present before the callback we enqueued from line 4
, will be run and "Read Error" will be consoled.
