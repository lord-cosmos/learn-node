- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

Answer :
 the order of execution ; 

foo
baz
foo
baz
2 : bar
1 : bar


By line 12,
'foo' is displayed from line 5,
setTimeout is async call- goes into in timers queue.
so, it will pushed, but baz runs immediately as its
synchronous.
the main thread is done here and as there is no I/O - no polling, therefore, event loop then 
runs the callbacks from pending callbacks.
